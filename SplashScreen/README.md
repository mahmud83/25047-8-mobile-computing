# Splash screen Activity #

This is a laboratory activity done last August 12, 2017 for 25048 Mobile Computing in Adamson University (1st semester, 2017-2018). The objectives of this activity are as follows:

* Create a splash screen, then transition to next activity
* Get rid of going back to splash screen when user presses "back" on his/her Android phone
* Create a third activity that goes back to the second activity when the user presses "back", instead of going to onDestroy() phase of the life cycle.
