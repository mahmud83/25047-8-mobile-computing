# ImageView Animation #

This is a laboratory activity done last August 5, 2017 for 25048 Mobile Computing in Adamson University (1st semester, 2017-2018). The objective of this activity is to create a simple animation on ImageViews.
That is, to fade out the first ImageView object while rotating it, with the second ImageView object fading in while rotating the opposite direction the first object did.
